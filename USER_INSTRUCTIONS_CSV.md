# 📋 User Instructions - eBird CSV Import

## ✅ **CRITICAL: Use "Last Seen" for Accurate Year/Month Lists**

---

## 🎯 **HOW TO DOWNLOAD YOUR EBIRD CSV (CORRECTLY):**

### **Step 1: Go to Your Life List**
Visit: https://ebird.org/lifelist

### **Step 2: Click "Last seen" Tab** ⚠️ IMPORTANT!
Look at the top of your life list and click the **"Last seen"** tab (NOT "First seen")

**Why?** The "Last seen" tab shows your most recent observation date for each species, which is what we need for accurate year/month filtering.

### **Step 3: Download CSV**
Click the **"Download (csv)"** button in the top right

### **Step 4: Upload to Traveling Birder**
Come back here and upload the CSV file

## 📊 **WHAT EACH TAB DOES:**

### **"First seen" Tab (Default):**
- Shows the FIRST time you ever saw each species
- Example: Common Grackle - May 12, 2018
- ❌ Year/month filters won't work correctly

### **"Last seen" Tab (What You Need):**
- Shows the MOST RECENT time you saw each species
- Example: Common Grackle - November 20, 2025
- ✅ Year/month filters work perfectly!

---

## 🎯 **HOW THE FILTERS WORK:**

### **After Upload, You Can Filter:**

**"All Species"**
- Shows every bird in the search results
- No filtering

**"Life List Targets Only"**
- Hides birds you've EVER seen (anywhere, any time)
- Shows birds you've NEVER seen

**"Year List Targets Only"**
- Hides birds you've seen in 2025 (anywhere)
- Shows birds you HAVEN'T seen in 2025
- **Requires "Last seen" CSV for accuracy!**

**"Month List Targets Only"**
- Hides birds you've seen in December 2025 (anywhere)
- Shows birds you HAVEN'T seen in December 2025
- **Requires "Last seen" CSV for accuracy!**

---

## 💡 **EXAMPLE:**

### **Your Life List (Last Seen Tab):**
- Common Grackle: November 20, 2025
- Scarlet Tanager: July 22, 2024
- Snowy Owl: February 14, 2023

### **Search: New Hampshire, Last 30 days**

**Filter: "Year List Targets Only" (2025)**
- ✅ Shows: Scarlet Tanager (you haven't seen it in 2025)
- ✅ Shows: Snowy Owl (you haven't seen it in 2025)
- ❌ Hides: Common Grackle (you saw it in 2025)

**Result:** Perfect! You see birds that are targets for your 2025 year list!
